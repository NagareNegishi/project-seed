<!-- Template skeleton. Replace every <placeholder>.

<!-- TEMPORARY (seed work, not part of the template): remove this block and the
     plan file once all five skills are built. -->
**Active seed work**: adding five portable skills (pr-draft, systematic-debugging,
session-wrapup, dependency-upgrade, release-notes). Read `docs/plans/new-skills.md`
before continuing that work.

## Project Overview

<One paragraph: what the app does.>

- **Backend**: <framework + version> (`<backend-dir>/`)
- **Frontend**: <framework + version> (`<frontend-dir>/`)
- **Database**: <database + access layer>
- **Test project**: <test framework> (`<test-dir>/`)

The dev environment runs in a Dev Container (`.devcontainer/`).

## Docs

- `docs/progress.md` — read at session start; update after each major feature completes.
- `docs/plans/` — per-feature plan/decision files; read only the relevant file when working on a feature.

## Commands

### Backend (from `<backend-dir>/`)

```bash
<run command>
```

### Tests (from repo root or `<test-dir>/`)

```bash
<test command>
<single-test filter command>
```

### Frontend (from `<frontend-dir>/`)

```bash
<dev server command>    # <dev URL>
<build command>
```

## Configuration

### Backend

<Config file or env vars. One line per key: name — what it does, whether the app
fails fast without it.>

### Frontend

<Env vars, e.g. API base URL and which file sets it.>

## Architecture

### Backend

<One line per layer: where controllers/routes live, how data access works, which
concerns go through service abstractions. List models/DTOs only if their shape is
not obvious from the code.>

### Frontend

<Data flow in one line, e.g. pages → hooks → services → API. Routing table.
Path aliases.>

### Tests

<How tests are isolated (in-memory DB, mocks), anything a new test must set up.>
