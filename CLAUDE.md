**Skill work**: before polishing or adding a skill in `.claude/skills/`, read
`docs/skills/new-skills.md` (authoring and polish guide).

**Config work**: changes to `.claude/settings.json` (permissions, hooks) must cite
the relevant code.claude.com docs and get user sign-off before writing.

**Attribution**: never add Claude as author, co-author (`Co-Authored-By`), or
contributor in anything that goes to git — commits, merges, tags, PRs. Enforced
by a PreToolUse hook; policy: `docs/permissions/v3-no-coauthor.md`.

**Session notes**: record observations worth remembering as one-line entries in
`docs/notes.md` (gitignored) — not auto-memory; promote to CLAUDE.md or a skill
only with user review.

## Project Overview

<One paragraph: what the app does.>

- **Backend**: <framework + version> (`<backend-dir>/`)
- **Frontend**: <framework + version> (`<frontend-dir>/`)
- **Database**: <database + access layer>
- **Test project**: <test framework> (`<test-dir>/`)

The dev environment runs in a Dev Container (`.devcontainer/`).

## Docs

- `docs/progress.md` — read at session start; update after each major feature completes.
- `docs/plans/` — per-feature product plan/decision files; read only the relevant file when working on a feature.
- `docs/skills/` — plan/decision docs for the `.claude/skills/` tooling itself (authoring guide + per-skill decision logs). Kept out of `docs/plans/` so product plans don't mix with tooling meta-docs.

## Commands

### Backend (from `<backend-dir>/`)

```bash
<run command>
```

### Tests (from repo root or `<test-dir>/`)

```bash
<test command>
<single-test filter command>
```

### Frontend (from `<frontend-dir>/`)

```bash
<dev server command>    # <dev URL>
<build command>
```

## Configuration

### Backend

<Config file or env vars. One line per key: name — what it does, whether the app
fails fast without it.>

### Frontend

<Env vars, e.g. API base URL and which file sets it.>

## Architecture

### Backend

<One line per layer: where controllers/routes live, how data access works, which
concerns go through service abstractions. List models/DTOs only if their shape is
not obvious from the code.>

### Frontend

<Data flow in one line, e.g. pages → hooks → services → API. Routing table.
Path aliases.>

### Tests

<How tests are isolated (in-memory DB, mocks), anything a new test must set up.>
